# Bootcamp 2018 Search UI, PART 2

You must add a new widget in the UI. We want to be able to filter on the date with the help of a date picker.

Inside the file Bootcamp2.html, you will get access to a page with an already configured Date picker. The Date picker currently does not do anything meaningful.

You will need to complete the code in `CustomFilter.js` to get the final result.
